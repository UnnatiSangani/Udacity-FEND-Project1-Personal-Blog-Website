            <p>With its century-old temples, bustling hawker centres and lush green spaces, Singapore’s varied charms are bound to enchant visitors to our island. 
              Our city’s calendar of events is equally diverse, 
              and present travellers with ample opportunities to explore, indulge and express their passions.
    
              From the glitz and gasoline of the <span class="color"> <u>Grand Prix Season</u></span> 
              Singapore to the flavours and fragrances of the <span class="color"> <u>Singapore Food Festival</u></span>, here are 10 reasons to visit Singapore in 2020.
              </p><br>
    
              <h3 class="color">1) Indulge in world-class eats</h3>
              <p>With its well-deserved reputation as a global metropolis, Singapore is home to flavours for every palate.
              Our city boasts a constellation of 44 <u>Michelin-starred restaurants</u>, including three-star establishments Les Amis and Odette. Chow down on Australian-style barbeque at Burnt Ends, discover the intricate flavours of Peranakan* fare at Candlenut or feast on the world’s most affordable Michelin meal at Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle.
              </p>
              <p>Singapore’s unique hawker food culture is equally impressive, with our hawker centres serving up dishes that span Chinese, Malay and Indian culinary traditions from chicken rice, fish head curry to rojak and satay.
              </p>
              <p><em>*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.</em>
              </p><br>
                  
              <h3 class="color">2) Feast on new flavours at our food festivals</h3>
              <p>Eating is undoubtedly our nation’s past-time, and visitors can share in our love for food and drinks with an array of exciting events and festivals.
                  Local dishes such as <span class="color"><b>KOPI</b></span> (traditional local coffee), <span class="color"><b>SATAY</b></span> (grilled meat skeweres) and chilli crab take front and centre stage at the Singapore Food Festival, and alcohol connoisseurs can deepen their appreciation for artisanal liquor, cocktail making and mixology at the <span class="color"><u>Cocktail Festival.</u></span>
              </p>
              <br>        
              
              <h3 class="color">3) Discover inspiring art every where</h3>
              <p>Besides being a city of world-class museums, art galleries, events and festivals, Singapore is a city where art thrives in the most unlikely of places.
              </p> 
              <p>When you’re done exploring the grand halls of the National Museum of Singapore and marvelling at the massive Southeast Asian art collection in the National Gallery Singapore, you’ll discover how art comes alive across our island.
                Peruse the street art at Gelam Gallery, hunt for wall murals across our island or catch an outdoor performance against the backdrop of our stunning city skyline at <b>Esplanade—Theatres on The Bay.</b>
              </p><br>

              <h3 class="color">4) Find your muse at our annual cultural events</h3>
              <p>At Singapore’s annual cultural events, you’ll find artists, actors and writers of every stripe coming together to share new perspectives and works of art. The <span class="color"><em>Fringe Festival, Singapore Art Week,
                Singapore International Festival of Arts and Singapore Writers Festival</em></span> are just some of the many inspiring events that await visitors.
                  Traditional festivals and celebrations abound in Singapore as well, from the pounding drums and riveting river races of the Dragon Boat Festival to feats of religious devotion during Thaipusam and the kaleidoscope of colourful personalities at <span class="color"><u>Chingay Parade.</u></span>
              </p><br>

              <h3 class="color">5) Party till dawn in a city that never sleeps </h3>
              <p>From hidden watering holes to some of the region’s hottest clubs and bars, Singapore’s nightlife is more than just a scene—it’s an opportunity for adventure.
                11 Singaporean bars made the list of Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2019, including the 1920s-inspired Manhattan, secret oasis 28 Hong Kong Street and NATIVE, which serves up cocktails made from regionally-sourced produce and spirits.
                If you’re looking to get your dance shoes on, Singapore’s buzzing nightclubs include stalwarts like <b>Zouk</b> and new haunts like <b>MARQUEE—a sprawling</b> space with an indoor Ferris Wheel.
